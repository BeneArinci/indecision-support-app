## My indecision app support
A little project was done in my personal time to showcase my ability to use:
- React for developing a single-page application
- SCSS as CSS pre-processor
- External React libraries/components
- Webpack and Babel setups
- Prettier settings

## Run the app 
To run the app on your local machine you can use the following commands:
```
yarn
```
```
yarn dev
```
